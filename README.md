# Coursera Getting and Cleaning Data Course: Final Assignment

This repository contains the files needed to complete
the final assignment for the Coursera 'Getting and Cleaning' data course.
In addition to this README file, the following files are included in the repo.



1. **run_analysis.R**  This is the R script file that contains the code needed
to download the data files for this assignment, clean the data, and generate
the tidy data set of average values for all signals, for each volunteer and 
each motion activity type in the motion study.  The tidy data is written to a
text and csv data file.


2. **CodeBook.md**  This is the codebook markdown file that describes the variable
names in the final tidy data set, a description of what the R script is trying to 
achieve with the initial dataset, and also a list of steps and transformations 
required to extract and clean the original dataset and also to produce a tidy 
dataset output.
